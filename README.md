# CIS1415
CIS1415 Final Project Escape Room

Created using Python IDLE 3.11 and pygame module on Windows. 
You may need to update your software for program to load. 

Game Play:
Select items in the room to collect clues to figure out the numeric combination lock. The combination consists of a total of four 3-digit numbers.

 Notes:
 I am new to Python and am not a fan of it. I liked coming up with a concept; however, putting it into practice with such a multitude of requirements made meeting requirements difficult.
